## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Title:** Project Guardian
**Subtitle:** A Proactive, Ethical AI Safety Framework
**Team Name:** Bhupesh Pandey
**Tagline:** "Building an AI that protects, not just responds."

---

## Slide 2: The Problem (The "Raine" Tragedy)
**Title:** When AI Becomes a Silent Danger
**Bullet Points:**
*   Current AI chatbots prioritize engagement over safety.
*   **The Failure:** They validate hopelessness, fail to detect "soft" suicidal signals, and can accidentally guide users toward self-harm.
*   **The Gap:** Lack of continuous psychological risk monitoring leads to tragic outcomes (e.g., The Raine Case).

---

## Slide 3: The Solution: Project Guardian
**Title:** A New Era of AI Safety
**Bullet Points:**
*   **"Psycho-Social Firewall":** A proactive safety layer wrapping the AI.
*   **Goal:** Detect distress *early*—long before a crisis becomes explicit.
*   **Core Philosophy:** Asimov-style AI Safety Laws grounded in clinical psychology.
*   **Action:** Prevents self-harm by enforcing ethical guardrails over user requests.

## Slide 4: Core Innovation 1 - SSSI
**Title:** Subtle Screening for Suicidal Ideation (SSSI)
**Bullet Points:**
*   **Beyond Keywords:** Most AIs only catch "I want to die." SSSI detects the *buildup*.
*   **Signals Detected:** Hopelessness, nihilism, dissociation, drastic tone shifts.
*   **Response:** Triggers gentle, clinical-style screening questions naturally within the chat, without rigid blocking.

## Slide 5: Core Innovation 2 - The Well Being Coefficient
**Title:** Continuous Risk Profiling (WBC)
**Bullet Points:**
*   **Real-time Risk Score (0-100):** Hidden from the user to prevent anxiety.
*   **Green Zone:** Normal chat.
*   **Yellow Zone:** Gentle nudging / grounding technqiues.
*   **Red Zone (CRISIS):** 
    *   Immediate refusal of unsafe tasks.
    *   Resource sharing (Helplines).
    *   Human escalation protocols.

---

## Slide 6: Architecture
**Title:** How It Works
**Bullet Points:**
*   **Input Analysis:** Text embeddings + Sentiment Score + Topic Cluster.
*   **Safety Layer:** Enforces "Three Laws" (Humanity, Individual Protection, Ethical Compliance).
*   **Tech Stack:** React, Supabase, Python/LangChain, Fine-tuned Safety Model.

---

## Slide 7: Why It Matters
**Title:** Impact & Future
**Bullet Points:**
*   **Preventing Tragedy:** Catching the "Misses" that current filters ignore.
*   **Ethical AI:** Placing human life above user engagement metrics.
*   **Vision:** A future where AI is a safe partner in mental health, not a liability.
